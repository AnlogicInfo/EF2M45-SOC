Anlogic EF2 Serial SOC
======================
Device Brief 
----------------
The ELF2 family have four devices, which locate the low-cost, low-power programmable market. ELF2 devices are targeted for mass, cost-sensitive applications, enabling system designers to reduce costs while meeting growing bandwidth requirements.The ELF2 devices are based on an optimized low power process, and through the lowest cost to achieve higher functionality. Choosing ELF2 device is the most ideal in industrial users and small, low-cost applications in the communications industry.Anlogic technology provides rich design tools to help users implement complex designs effectively by using ELF2 platform.The industry-leading synthesis and place-routing tools provide a strong guarantee for users to design high-quality products.
